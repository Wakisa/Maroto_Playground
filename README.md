# Maroto_Playground

The Maroto Playground is a web based, tool for streamlining the design and layout of PDF reports/documents using the Maroto Go library. It should provide

- An editor that a user can write Go code to design the report with
- A button to initiate generation  and download of the PDF  
- Example reports that can be selected by the user
- An about page for contributors or supporters with link to this repository
- A backend that handles the Go code securely since we will be handling user input.
